This GitHub repository contains the source code for an Android calculator app developed using Android Studio. The calculator features a simple blue and white theme, giving it a clean and minimalist look.

The calculator has basic math functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with the ability to calculate percentages. The app also has buttons to clear the current input and to toggle between positive and negative numbers.

The calculator does not have an action bar, which helps in keeping the interface uncluttered and focused on the calculator's functions.

Overall, the GitHub repository provides a useful and practical calculator app that can be downloaded and installed on any Android device. It can be a great resource for anyone looking to learn more about Android app development or to create their own calculator app.
